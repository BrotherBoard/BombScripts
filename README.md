# BombScripts
A few scripts in one place

i was tired of finding the files and stuff so i combined them to one file that opens them for me.

usage: ``pkg install git && git clone https://github.com/BrotherBoard/BombScripts && cd BombScripts && bash start``


**included scripts:**

**Decimal Battery:**
to get your battery level in decimals for some unknown reason

**Decimal Battery Clean**
same as Decimal Battery, but written in a cleaner way, doesnt touch your internal storage and uses bash.rc to save its config

**Battery Level Changer:**
over su, change your battery level to something idk

**IP Address Adder:**
for localhosting and stuff, easier IP address management
